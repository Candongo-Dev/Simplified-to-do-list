# Simplified-to-do-list
Introdução ao HTML - CSS - JAVASCRIPT SISTEMA WEB:
The purpose of this application is to build a simple and dynamic to-do list.

HTML is the programming language responsible for creating the visual elements on the screen. 
In this app I explain the standard way that an HTML document works. 
In addition, as our app is a list of tasks, I used some elements, such as Div, Input, Button, LI and UL to create our list, so that the user can dynamically add the tasks of his day.
To make the app more beautiful, I used some CSS classes and properties, such as background-color, padding, margin, font-size and border-radius.
